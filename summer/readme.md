Use this file to keep a report stating what you completed over the summer. The following is an *template* that you can use as a basis. 

## Research completed
Read "Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies" by A.Narayanan et al. 2016
    ISBN: 978-0-691-17169-2

## Ideas developed

## Concerns or risks identified
Concerned about the scope of the project. In the bitcoin implementation there is the ability to have
code inseted in to transactions and there is a language this code can be writen in. I believe this to be
out of scope for my project but will confirm with supervisor.
