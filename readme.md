# Demonstrating the security of a basic cryptocurrency

This is my final year dissertation project

## Abstract
Over the past decade, cryptocurrency has become a rapidly growing area of interest as it aims to provide a 
decentralised alternative to regular physical currencies. The goal of this project is to implement a secure 
peer-based cryptocurrency. It is designed to include a distributed, tamper-proof ledger, a consensus mechanism 
for distributing transactions to all participating nodes, a mining system, and wallets for sending 
the currency between different addresses. It also includes a test harness so that a number of nodes 
can be created and run on a single computer in order to test the system. Several tests are run in order to
test the project's resistance to double spend attacks, Sybil attacks, and other attacks on the blockchain. 
Thees tests prove that the cryptocurrency created is secure.
