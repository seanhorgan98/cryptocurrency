Meeting 14
Date: 30/01/20

Got a good amount of work done and finished of the node and consensus mechanisms.
This leaves only tidying up code and finishing off bug fixes to complete.

Plan for next week is to try to finish off the main coding of the project. Getting
the main class to start running a test harness and maybe adding in some unit tests
or dissertation work if I have time.
