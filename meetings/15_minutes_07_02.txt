Meeting 15
Date: 07/02/20

I have mainly finished the coding part of the project with only a few minor
parts to fix in the test harness in order to get it running. This week mainly
consisted of bug fixing in the nodes and transaction classes. Was struggling
with a double spending issue again.

We discussed how important the cleanliness of the code will be in the final 
assessment and agreed as long as I am able to navigate the code it should not
be a problem as there will be no maintainers of the code after me. Although I
will try to keep the code tidy if I ever want to show the code to potential
employers.

Next meeing is same time next week.
