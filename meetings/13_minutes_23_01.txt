Meeting 13
Date: 23/01/20

I had a very busy week this week due to personal reasons and so I was
only able to fix some minor fixes and make some progress researching
how to implement the consensus and flooding algorithms.

We talked about how having the whole program run from a main class which
will create a large amount of nodes and simulate a network sending transactions
will be fine for the scope of the project.
Also discussed running the program with an argument to let the user choose
the random seed. Finally talked about how the heap structure for nodes sending
coins will work.

Plan for next week is to try to finish off the nodes and consensus part of the
project.
