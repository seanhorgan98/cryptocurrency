Meeting 17
Date: 20/02/20

This week I made slight changes to the main function of the program and
completed the introduction section for the dissertation. As Dr Poet will
be away next week the next meeting will be on the 5th of March. Plan for this
two week period is to complete the background and analysis section for the 
dissertation and send what I have completed to Dr Poet before the meeting
to look over.
