Meeting 10
Date: 03/12/19

This week I finished of last weeks work by removing the coin creation via
altering the UTXO list on the blockchain. I added a way of creating a transaction
to be added to a block in order to keep coin creation immutable and part of
the blockchain. I also changed transactions so they were called as a method
of wallets. This means I can also keep track of wallet balances and make sure
that wallets have sufficient funds in order to make a transaction.

Clarified the extent of the test harness I am supposed to implement in order
to run multiple nodes on the same computer.

Plan for next week is to start working on nodes and how the consensus/flooding
algorithm will work.
