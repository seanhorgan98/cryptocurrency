Meeting 6
Date: 05/11/19

As I had a busy week due to coursework for all the modules being released and 
busy away hockey fixtures I was only able to add a basic blockchain validation
method and clean up the overall code of the project. I also set up the 
enviroment for the dissertation and changed the title, metadata, etc.

The plan for the next week is to finish off adding unit tests for the different
data structures and and continue to work of the background sections for the
dissertation.

The next meeting will be at 4pm on Tuesday the 12th of November.
