Meeting 3
Date: 08/10/19

Discussed the progress I made validating the blockchain and started creating
basic mining functionality. Also did research on merkle trees for storing transactions inside blocks

Asked about how the future mining functoinality will work when on a large scale.
Decided the basic process I am using now will be able to work if the target value for the
hashing calculations is set to an easy difficulty.

Planned for the next week to implement the transactions and have them added to blocks
and stored using merkle trees.

Next meeting is planned for Tuesday the 15th at 16:00
