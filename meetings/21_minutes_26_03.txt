Meeting 22
Date 26/03/20

Again there was no meeting this week as the coronavirus continues to 
shutdown the country. This week I completed up to and including the
implementation sections of the dissertation. Plan for next week is to
finish off the whole paper and submit.

Talked about how important it is to meet the 40 page limit which I might
not be able to meet and also the areas to focus on when delivering the
presentation.
