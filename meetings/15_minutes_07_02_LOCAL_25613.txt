Meeting 15
Date: 07/02/20

Discussed how I am still almost finished the implementation however,
I was struggling with a few bugs during the week. 

We also talked about how clean the code needed to be. Dr Poet told me
that it wasn't all that important and that the comments were only really necesary
for my own use in navigating the program as there would not be other
maintainers on the project that would need to read the code.

Plan for next week is as usual to finish off the implementation.

Next meeting is back on schedule for next Thursday at 11:30
