Meeting 12
Date: 16/01/20

I was away over almost the entirety of the chirstmas break so couldn't get
any of the programming work done however I believe I have made good progress
so far and don't think this is an issue. I made good progress deciding on how
I will go about evaluating the project using unit test etc.

Plan for this week is to make progress on the nodes and consensus algorithms
to hopefully get close to finishing off the project.
