Meeting 20
Date 19/03/20

Due to the coronavirus pandemic there was no face to face meeting. We are communicating
via email for the moment. This week I completed the design section for the dissertation.
Currently the section is a little small however there is more that I might be able to add
if I have space in the end.

Plan for next week is to get a solid chunk of the implementation section done.

It is looking like there will also not be a meeting next week so we will continue to
communicate via email.
