Meeting 5
Date: 29/10/19

Over the past 2 weeks I added signature functionality for generating and verifying signatures
for transactions. I created the merkle tree structure for when transactions are added to
blocks. I also created basic wallet functionality to start testing the transaction process
and see how transfering values between public keys is working. Also changed the stringUtil
hashing function.

Decided it would be a good idea to start working on the background work for the dissertation
as soon as possible while it is still fresh in my mind.

Plan for next week is to add some unit tests to verify that the blockchain is valid and also
that the merkle tree structure in the blocks is correct. I also plan to start working on the 
dissertation.

The next meeting will be at 4pm on Tuesday the 5th of November.
