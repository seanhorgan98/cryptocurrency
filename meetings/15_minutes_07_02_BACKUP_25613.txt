Meeting 15
Date: 07/02/20

<<<<<<< HEAD
Discussed how I am still almost finished the implementation however,
I was struggling with a few bugs during the week. 

We also talked about how clean the code needed to be. Dr Poet told me
that it wasn't all that important and that the comments were only really necesary
for my own use in navigating the program as there would not be other
maintainers on the project that would need to read the code.

Plan for next week is as usual to finish off the implementation.

Next meeting is back on schedule for next Thursday at 11:30
=======
I have mainly finished the coding part of the project with only a few minor
parts to fix in the test harness in order to get it running. This week mainly
consisted of bug fixing in the nodes and transaction classes. Was struggling
with a double spending issue again.

We discussed how important the cleanliness of the code will be in the final 
assessment and agreed as long as I am able to navigate the code it should not
be a problem as there will be no maintainers of the code after me. Although I
will try to keep the code tidy if I ever want to show the code to potential
employers.

Next meeing is same time next week.
