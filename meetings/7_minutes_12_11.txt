Meeting 7
Date 12/11/19

Implemented some basic merkle tree validation. Tested the whole process
of creating wallets, creating transactions, adding those transactions to 
blocks and mining those blocks. Then adding those blocks to the blockchain.
Made sure that this was all working and all the hashs matched up and the
data structures were all valid. I also did some work on the dissertation,
adding the abstract.

The plan for next week is to distinguise between coin creation transactions
and actual transaction between two wallets. This as well as updating balances
in wallets when transactions are recieved.
