Meeting 16
Date: 13/02/20

This week I was encountering lots of double spending issues when the number
of transaction in the block were kept small. We decided this was actually a 
feature of cryptocurencies and not a bug that I was having. In a real world 
scenario with lots more transactions and nodes it should work well.

Decided it was definiately time to put the main focus onto the dissertation
and not the code. Plan for the next week is to make a start on the introduction
section and planning the dissertation.

Next meeting 11:30 Thursday.
