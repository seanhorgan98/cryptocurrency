Meeting 8
Date: 19/11/19

This week I created a hashmap for unspent transaction outputs in order to keep track
of coins. This allowed me to store the balance for each wallet and update this balance
by looping through the UTXOs and summing all transactions that match the wallet's 
public key. I also implemented coin creation by adding a new transaction output to the 
UTXO map.

We decided that it is not secure to simply add to the UTXO map to create coins as only
the transactions are immutable. This means that next week I will change the coin creation
to create a new transaction.
I also confirmed that updating the wallet balance should be client side and not when the
block is created.

Plan for next week is to fix the coin creation, wallet transaction validation eg checking
the wallet has enough coins to send when creating a transaction. Finally to start researching
the plan for consensus and proof of work algorithms.
