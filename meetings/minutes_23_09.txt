Meeting 1
Date: 23/09/19

Discussed any work I completed over summer and what research I have conducted. For me I had read the Cryptocurrency technology book that was suggested to me before summer.

Talked about how the issues with using mining in a project of this scale and how it would take a large amount of time to generate a new block because of the limitations on hardware that I have access to. Instead of the regular mining method, instead I will most likely have to have each node generate a random number and then have the node that selected the lowest number be the one to "mine" the block.

We also discussed how the main test harness will be one of the biggest challanges to this project.

There will be a security focus to this project and the blockchain must be resistant to many different attacks.

Decided the plan for this week will be to start work on the blockchain and try some basic tests.

We decided the next meeting will be held at 3:30 on Tuesday the 1st.
