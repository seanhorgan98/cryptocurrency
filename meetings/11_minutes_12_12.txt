Meeting 11
Date: 12/12/19

This week I tested the full process and fixed a lot of bugs. We had the
main project lecture so I spent time thinking about evaluation and reread
some of the HoF dissertations.

Plan is to decide exactly on how to evaluate the project and to also make 
progress woking on nodes and the consensus algorithm implementation.
