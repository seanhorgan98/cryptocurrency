Meeting 2
Date: 01/10/19

Discussed the progress I made creating the Block & Blockchain data structures. I also started testing their implementation and the links to the other blocks with hashs.

Decided the github repository should be private.

Decided to leave the OP_codes used in bitcoin to verify transactions out of scope for the moment but can add them in at a later date if all is going well.

Plan for next week is to start implementing transactions into the blocks. We agreed I would implement these using a merkle tree structure in the blocks.

We decided the next meeting will be held at 16:00 on Tuesday the 8th.
