Meeting 18
Date: 05/03/20

Disscussed how I completed the introduction, background research
and analysis/requirements sections on the dissertation. Talked about changing
the title to "Demonstrating the security of a basic cryptocurrency" in order
to make the evaluation section easier to frame. How I should try my best to not
repeat myself and to mention some other cryptocurrencies (like ethereum contracts)
in the background research section. Should also maybe mention proof of steak as 
well as proof of work. Also talked about how the amount of time spent shouldn't 
really matter that much as long as the content I provide is adequate.

Plan for next week is to make a solid start on the design section.

Next meeting is same time next week.
