Meeting 9
Date: 26/11/19

Was very busy this week with coursework due for other courses and 
traveling due to 3 hockey matches. Because of this I was unable to find
time to work on the project.

Then plan for next week is to finish off the previous weeks work like ading
validation to wallets balances when creating transactions and making sure
coin creation is secure. I also plan to create a roadmap for the work I will
be doing over the Christmas break.

The next meeting will be the same time next week. 4pm Tuesday.
